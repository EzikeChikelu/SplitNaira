# Ledger Transaction Finality Policy

Issue #1478. Code: [`backend/src/services/ledger-finality.ts`](../backend/src/services/ledger-finality.ts).
Tests: [`backend/src/__tests__/ledger-finality.test.ts`](../backend/src/__tests__/ledger-finality.test.ts).

## Confirmation assumptions

Stellar closes ledgers with the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP). Once the ledger
that contains a transaction closes, the transaction's result is **final**: SCP
does not reorganize closed ledgers, so there is no probabilistic "wait N blocks"
like on proof-of-work chains. Ledgers close roughly every 5–6 seconds.

The backend still applies a per-network policy, for operational reasons:

| Network | Passphrase | `confirmationDepth` | `submissionTimeoutLedgers` | Resets possible |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mainnet | `Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015` | 1 | 120 (~10 min) | No |
| testnet | `Test SDF Network ; September 2015` | 0 | 120 | Yes (periodic SDF resets) |
| futurenet | `Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022` | 0 | 120 | Yes (frequent) |
| standalone | `Standalone Network ; February 2017` | 0 | 60 | Yes (local container) |

- **`confirmationDepth`** is the number of ledgers that must close *after* the
  inclusion ledger before the backend books the transaction as `completed`. On
  mainnet we require 1. That isn't for consensus safety. It makes sure the
  load-balanced RPC we read from, and the event listener that writes
  `transactions` and `ledger_blocks`, have both moved past the inclusion ledger
  before money is reported as settled.
- **`submissionTimeoutLedgers`** is how long a transaction with no known ledger
  or time bound may stay unseen before it is treated as `expired`. Submitters
  should set a ledger bound or time bound no longer than this window. When
  `validUntilLedger` is known, it takes precedence over the default window,
  because after that ledger closes the transaction can never be applied.
- **Resets.** On testnet, futurenet and standalone, "final" only holds until the
  next network reset. Never treat testnet settlement as evidence for mainnet
  accounting.

Policies resolve from `SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` by **exact** match.
`getFinalityPolicy` fails closed with `unknown_network` for any other value, so
a typo cannot quietly inherit testnet's lax settings. Policies are frozen at
runtime.

## State machine

```
submitted ──► included ──► final        (terminal, → completed)
    │
    ├──► final                          (depth already reached)
    ├──► failed                         (terminal, on-ledger failure → failed)
    └──► expired                        (terminal, never landed → failed)
```

Only `final` maps to `TransactionStatus = "completed"`. `included` and
`submitted` stay `pending`.

### Transition rules

- **Monotonic.** A lagging RPC node can return `NOT_FOUND` for a transaction we
  already saw included, or report a lower `latestLedger`. These reads never move
  a record backwards. `evaluateFinality` keeps the previous state and sets
  `regressionIgnored: true`.
- **Depth is never negative.** If the node's `latestLedger` is behind the
  inclusion ledger, depth is clamped to 0, so an inconsistent node cannot
  fast-track finality.
- **Conflicts escalate.** An observation that contradicts a terminal state
  throws `finality_conflict`, and the record is left unchanged. Examples: a
  `final` transaction later reported `FAILED`, or an `expired` transaction
  that later lands. Treat this as an incident: see
  [orphaned-transaction-remediation.md](./orphaned-transaction-remediation.md)
  and [runbooks/stuck-payouts.md](./runbooks/stuck-payouts.md).
- Malformed observations (missing, zero, fractional or negative ledger numbers)
  throw `invalid_observation`.

## Operator notes

- To change a policy value, edit `FINALITY_POLICIES` and update the table above
  in the same PR. The tests assert that mainnet stays at least as strict as
  every resettable network.
- After a testnet or futurenet reset, records that were `final` on the old
  network still read `completed`, and new lookups for them return `NOT_FOUND`
  (ignored as a lagging read). Clear testnet data after a reset, not mainnet.
- Validation: `npm test -- ledger-finality` (no network access required).
